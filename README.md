# Overview

Thingzee is a smart home inventory system. It allows you to add items from your
home and track their location and quantity. By periodically updating the quantity of
items as you use them, a machine learning model predicts the amounts of consumable items
you own. It can use this data to generate automatic shopping lists so you never run out of
the things you need.

## Status

Thingzee is in heavy development. It is a partial rewrite of an existing app, so some features are not fully implemented yet. Many things work, but the app is not yet ready for widespread general use.
