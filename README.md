# Thingzee - Smart Home Inventory

## Overview

Thingzee is a smart home inventory system. It allows you to add items from your
home and track their location and quantity.

By periodically updating the quantity of items as you use them, a machine learning model
is able to predict the amounts of consumable items you own at any given time. As you add more data it becomes more accurate.

It can use this data to generate automatic shopping lists so you never run out of the things you need.

## Status

Thingzee is in heavy development. Many things work, but some features are not fully implemented yet. It is recommended to backup your data periodically using the export feature.

Cloud account signup is currently disabled due to frequent database changes. The default offline mode is fully functional.
